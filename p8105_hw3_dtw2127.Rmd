```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

First we'll load in the instacart data and do an exploration of the dataset.

```{r}
data("instacart")

str(instacart)
```

The instacart dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows of data for `r ncol(instacart)` variables. Key variables include order ID, product ID, add to cart order, user ID, order hour of day, days since prior order, and department. 

There are `r pull(instacart, aisle) %>% unique() %>% length()` aisles. Let's determine which aisle the most items are ordered from. 

```{r}
instacart %>% group_by(aisle) %>% summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% arrange(desc(n_obs))
```
The most items are ordered from the fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables and fruits aisle.
