```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

First we'll load in the instacart data and do an exploration of the dataset.

```{r}
data("instacart")

str(instacart)
```

The instacart dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows of data for `r ncol(instacart)` variables. Key variables include order ID, product ID, add to cart order, user ID, order hour of day, days since prior order, and department.
